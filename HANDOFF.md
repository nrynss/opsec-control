# HANDOFF.md — Builder onboarding & current repo state

Operational companion to [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (the rules) and
[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) (the design). Start here when you pick up a task.

> **Builder** = you, an AI writing this code.  **Cell** = a runtime agent inside
> the product. Never conflate them.

## 1. Read order (do not skip)

1. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — the seven rules, in full.
2. [`SPEC.md` §0](SPEC.md) — the binding Multi-Agent Development Protocol.
3. The SPEC section(s) for **your** package, then the **§16.1 ownership table**.
4. [`internal/contracts/`](internal/contracts/) — the only source of truth for
   any cross-package shape.

## 2. Pre-flight checklist (SPEC §0.3) — before writing a line

- [ ] My task touches **only the package(s) I own** (§16.1). If not → **stop and flag**.
- [ ] I've read the contract files my package depends on.
- [ ] Anything I need from another package exists as an **interface** in
      `contracts/interfaces.go`. If a shape is missing, I do **not** invent it
      locally — I raise a contract change (§4 below).
- [ ] I can build & test my package in isolation against contract fakes.

## 3. Current repo state

The **skeleton + v0 contracts** are in place. Every `internal/*` package has a
`doc.go` stating its owner, dependencies, and "must-not" (from §16.1). The two
`cmd` mains are stubs. `web/` is intentionally **not** scaffolded (frontend
Builder's lane — see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md)).

| Area | State | Owner picks up |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/contracts/` | **v0 types defined** (events, state, agentio, interfaces, scenario, errors) | refine via §0.5 only |
| `internal/contracts/contracttest/` | seed round-trip test | extend (collectively owned) |
| `internal/state` + `validation` | **implemented (Claude Builder)** | world state + §14.2 gate |
| `internal/events` | **implemented by Codex Builder** | event bus |
| `internal/anomaly` | **implemented by Grok Builder** (Classifier via §0.5 w/ orchestrator) | fan-out triggers |
| `internal/orchestrator` | **implemented by Antigravity Builder** | concurrent fan-out + Commander |
| `internal/agents` | **implemented (Gemma 4 31B on Cerebras Builder)** | the six Cells |
| `internal/llm` | **implemented by Antigravity Builder** | Cerebras client |
| `internal/simulation` + `scenario` | **implemented by Grok Builder** | sim clock + replay |
| `internal/scenariogen` (+`cmd`) | **implemented** — drafted by Gemma 4 31B on Cerebras Builder, **rescued/completed by Claude Builder** (Gemma 429'd; substrate-corruption bug + llm-ctor + test fixed) | offline authoring tool → validated, frozen `scenario.json` |
| `internal/timeline` | **implemented** (Poolside Laguna M) | event log |
| `internal/sensors` | stub | ingest adapters |
| `internal/api` + `websocket` | **implemented by Grok Builder** | HTTP/WS edge |
| `cmd/eoc` (server wiring) | **implemented (Claude Builder)** — end-to-end flow tested live | integration root: wires all pkgs + runs the anomaly→fan-out loop, serves api/ws |
| `web/` | **implemented by Antigravity Builder** | Astro+Svelte dashboard |

**MVD build order (SPEC §13):** scenario+sim → events → state → anomaly →
orchestrator fan-out of 2–3 Cells → Commander → dashboard.

**Claimed (2026-06-29) — BUG-4/BUG-5 state-completeness** ([`TASK-state-completeness.md`](TASK-state-completeness.md)):
- Full Part A: Road entity + EventRoadBlocked handler; EventBridgeCollapsed + PowerDegraded.
- Part B1: BuildingCollapsed / TunnelClosed documented as deliberate trigger-only (no entity) + pinning tests.
- Contract change per §0.5 (additive only), LegalRoad bidirectional, wake rules, all tests + contracttest, acceptance criteria.

**Claimed by Claude Builder (2026-06-29) — review hardening, P1 contracts, deploy planning:**
- **Review fixes** (from 4 LLM code reviews): BUG-1 mock LLM honors `ctx` cancellation; BUG-2 `Envelope` rejects negative timestamps; BUG-3 seeded LLM backoff `rand` (determinism §0.2 r5); BUG-7 removed dead `orch` field from `api.Server`. Tests added.
- **Repo-wide `modernize` sweep:** `maps.Copy`, range-over-int, `atomic.Int32`, `slices.Contains`, `t.Context`, tagged switch, `any` — zero gopls hints remain.
- **P1 (contracts, §0.5 additive):** HUD telemetry — `CellMetrics`+`CellOutput.Metrics`, `COPMetrics`+`COP.Metrics`, `LLMResponse.LatencyMS`; contracttest extended. **Unblocks P2–P5.**
- **Planning:** authored [`TASK-state-completeness.md`](TASK-state-completeness.md); reviewed the BUG-4/5 impl; parceled the Cerebras-effectiveness work (§8, P1–P8) and rewrote [`hosting.md`](hosting.md) for single-origin deploy.
- Verified: `go build`/`vet`/`gofmt`/`go test ./...` + `contracttest` all green.
- **Next (open):** P9–P16 (multi-provider support with global switch + UI fixes for map size, data areas, and persistent scrolling logs). All prior parcels (P1–P8) landed.

### 3.1 Remaining work & parallelism (post-spine)

The reasoning spine (sim → events → state → anomaly → orchestrator → Cells →
Commander) is **complete and green**. What's left, and what can run concurrently:

- **`internal/api` + `websocket`** — **implemented by Grok Builder** (independent). Its deps
  (`StateStore`/`EventBus`/`Orchestrator` interfaces) are all done. Codes to
  `contracts/*`; imports neither `cmd/eoc` nor `web`.
- **`web/`** — **build-independent** (separate Astro/Svelte toolchain); can be
  scaffolded now against `contracts/schemas`. Needs a running `api` only for
  live data, not to start.
- **`cmd/eoc`** — the integration root; imports everything. Splits in two:
  - **headless reasoning loop** (sim → bus → `state.Apply` → `anomaly.Classify`
    → `orchestrator.FanOut` → log the COP) depends only on already-done
    packages → buildable + smoke-testable **now**, no api/web needed. Fastest
    proof the spine works end-to-end.
  - **HTTP serving** wiring depends on `api`+`websocket` landing first.

Dependency shape:

```
api+websocket ┐
              ├─> cmd/eoc  (wires all packages; serves the HTTP/WS edge)
web/ ─────────┘   (web → api at runtime, for live data)
```

So **`api`+`websocket` and `web/` can proceed in parallel**, and **`cmd/eoc`'s
headless loop can start in parallel too** — only cmd/eoc's *serving* wiring must
wait for `api`. Mind the measured Cerebras ceiling (4 concurrent, 100 RPM/TPM —
see §6) when the loop fans out live.

**`internal/scenariogen` (+`cmd/scenariogen`)** — being built as an **offline
authoring tool**: Gemma drafts the curated 3-act anomaly beats → validated by
replay through `state.New(Initial)` + `Apply` → frozen to a deterministic,
reviewable `scenario.json`. It **never** runs on the live path (§14.1); its only
product is the frozen file the simulation replays.

**Deferrable for the MVD:** `internal/sensors` (the simulation is the event
source). Volume/liveness — the "thousands of data points" — comes from a
**templated, non-LLM** ambient-noise generator (§14.3) layered in later, **not**
from scenariogen or the live LLM path. Keep the signal (curated, LLM-authored,
frozen) separate from the volume (templated, cheap, deterministic).

## 4. Changing a contract — the ONLY cross-lane action (SPEC §0.5)

You may **not** unilaterally edit `internal/contracts/`. Instead:

1. Propose the change: **what** field/type, **why**, **who** it affects.
2. Get agreement.
3. Land it as its **own isolated commit** touching only `contracts/`
   (message `contract(<file>): …`).
4. Each affected owner then updates their package.

Contract changes are **additive by default**; a breaking change updates every
consumer in the same pass.

## 5. Command cheat-sheet (Taskfile — SPEC §19.1)

```sh
task                 # list tasks
task check           # build + vet + test — the local gate before "done"
task test            # unit tests
task contracttest    # the shared contract suite (§0.6) — must pass
task build:eoc       # build the server binary
task run             # run the EOC server
task docker:build    # Linux image — the build authority (§19.3)
```

## 6. The traps that fail only in CI/Docker (not on your machine)

- **Determinism is law (§0.2 r5):** no wall-clock reads, no unseeded `rand`, no
  map-iteration-order in logic that affects state/output. Use the injected sim
  clock and the scenario `Seed`. Event time is `contracts.SimTime` (scenario
  seconds), **not** wall time.
- **Cross-platform (§19.2):** lowercase package dirs/filenames (Linux is
  case-sensitive); paths via `filepath.Join`; bundle assets with `//go:embed`;
  no shell one-liners in build scripts. LF endings are enforced by
  `.gitattributes`.
- **No shared mutable global state (§0.2 r4):** only `internal/state` holds live
  world state, and it has one mutator path (`StateStore.Apply`).
- **Cerebras Concurrency Limit Warning:** The developer account has a strict **concurrency ceiling of 4 concurrent in-flight requests** (100 RPM / 100k TPM). Because the MVD uses 4 Cells (Infrastructure, Medical, Population, Commander), any multi-turn loops (such as plan->critique->refine) executing in parallel *will* hit HTTP 429s. The LLM client handles this gracefully via internal queueing and backoff/retry, but orchestrator/agent builders should be aware of this tight concurrency budget.

## 7. Definition of done (SPEC §0 / §19.3)

Your package builds in isolation, ships unit tests, **passes the full
`contracttest` suite**, is `gofmt`-clean, and touched **no files outside your
lane** (except a coordinated §0.5 contract commit). Green Linux CI = green
everywhere.

## 8. Cerebras-effectiveness work parcels (hackathon, 2026-06-29)

Source: [`CEREBRAS-EFFECTIVENESS.md`](CEREBRAS-EFFECTIVENESS.md). Four gaps between
the "wafer-scale parallel reasoning" thesis and the current build. Parceled by
lane so they run mostly in parallel **after the one contracts change (P1) lands**.

### Reality check vs. the doc (read before picking a parcel)
- **The hard 4-concurrent ceiling (§6) is the real constraint — NOT the client
  cap.** Raising `llm` `maxConcurrency` 4→6 does not speed anything up; it trades
  client-side queueing for server-side HTTP 429 + backoff (i.e. *worse* latency).
  The real lever is *how many cells fan out at once* (cell roster) and/or a higher
  Cerebras account limit.
- **Roster decision (2026-06-29): register all 6 cells.** A mainshock now wakes
  **5 specialists** → 5 concurrent calls against the 4-cap. The `llm` client's
  semaphore (`maxConcurrency=4`) **is the queue**: 4 run immediately, the 5th
  blocks on the channel (Go serves blocked senders FIFO) until a slot frees, then
  runs — so we **never exceed 4 in-flight and never trip a 429**. With near-instant
  Cerebras inference the 5th's wait ≈ one request-duration (negligible).
  **Keep `maxConcurrency=4`; do NOT raise it** — raising removes the queue and
  causes server-side 429s + backoff (worse). This also **resolves BUG-6** (anomaly
  was waking unregistered Intelligence/Communications). Caveat: all-6 ×
  (optional critique) multiplies *total* requests → watch the 100 RPM / 100k TPM
  budget; gate critique (P3) accordingly.
- **Critique loops don't raise *peak* concurrency** (each cell holds one in-flight
  request at a time), but they multiply **total** requests → keep plan→critique
  **sequential within a cell** and watch the 100 RPM / 100k TPM budget.

### Parcels

**Status legend:** ✅ Done · 🔵 Claimed (in progress) · ⬜ Unclaimed (free to pick up).
To claim: change the cell to 🔵 with your builder name + date in the same commit you start.

| ID | Status | Lane / owner | Work | Depends on |
|----|--------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **P1** | ✅ **Done** — Claude Builder (commit `47a4809`) | `internal/contracts/` (§0.5 — isolated commit) | Add `CellMetrics{tokensIn,tokensOut,tokensPerSec,latencyMs}` + `CellOutput.Metrics`; `COPMetrics{fanOutLatencyMs,totalTokensIn,totalTokensOut,peakTokensPerSec,aggregateTokensPerSec,cellCount}` + `COP.Metrics`; `LLMResponse.LatencyMS`. All **additive**. (`Perception`/`ImageInput` already exist.) | — |
| **P2** | ✅ **Done** — Antigravity Builder (2026-06-29) | `internal/llm` | Populate `LatencyMS` (real + mock); implement `Interpret` in new `perception.go` (mock + Cerebras vision `gemma-4-31b`, base64 data-URI, structured `[]Event`); **keep `maxConcurrency=4` (the semaphore IS the FIFO queue — never raise; see reality-check)**; optionally expose queue depth / wait-time as telemetry. | P1 ✅ |
| **P3** | ✅ **Done** — Grok Builder (commit `58d881c`) | `internal/agents` | **Add `NewIntelligence` + `NewCommunications` cell constructors** (mirror the existing 4; seismic/intel + comms prompts; mock responses already exist) so all 6 can be registered. `executeLLM` writes real metrics into `CellOutput.Metrics`; add **sequential** plan→critique pass (env-gated `LLM_CRITIQUE`, graceful fallback to draft on failure), aggregating tokens + latency. | P1 ✅ |
| **P4** | ✅ **Done** — Antigravity Builder (2026-06-29) | `internal/orchestrator` | Time the fan-out (wall clock around phase-1/2); aggregate specialist + Commander metrics into `COP.Metrics`. | P1 ✅, P3 |
| **P5** | ✅ **Done** — Grok Builder (2026-06-29) | `internal/api` | `POST /perception` (multipart or raw bytes → `Perception.Interpret` → publish events to bus). Inject a `Perception` dependency into `Server`. Handler stamps sim time for validity + publishes to bus. Tests + isolation green. | P1 ✅, P2 |

All four sub-tasks landed, `go build` + `go test ./...` + `contracttest` green. | P2, P5, P3(d) |
| **P7** | ✅ **Done** — Antigravity Builder (2026-06-29) | `web/` | HUD reads `cop.metrics` (real tok/s + fan-out latency, replacing the hardcoded `1500`); add a drone/satellite image upload widget → `POST /perception`. **Single-origin (see §8 deploy decision): keep the existing same-origin WS/fetch — do NOT add a `PUBLIC_API_URL`.** | P1 ✅ (shapes), running `api` |
| **P8** | ✅ **Done** — Grok Builder (2026-06-29) | `Dockerfile` + `Taskfile.yml` + `.env.example` (deploy/build lane; `hosting.md` already done) | **Multi-stage image**: Node stage builds `web/dist` → Go stage builds `eoc` → distroless runtime carrying the binary **and** `web/dist`.

| **P14** | ⬜ **Unclaimed** — **scoped in [`TASK-ui-scrollback.md`](TASK-ui-scrollback.md)** | `web/` | Make timeline, matrix feed, logs hold full history + proper scrolling (instead of refresh/overwrite). **Decision: everything accumulates** — feeds + Commander COP + specialist Cell outputs all become scrolling histories. | — (independent of P9–P12; see task doc) |
| **P15** | ⬜ **Unclaimed** | `web/` | Additional UI polish: improve controls, badges, perception panel, live vs demo clarity, general layout/responsiveness. | P14 |
| **P16** | 🔵 **Claimed — Claude Builder (2026-06-29)** | deploy/build + docs | Document OPENROUTER_* in .env.example + hosting.md. Update any deploy notes for dual providers. Validate both providers work for text + vision. | P8, P9 |

### Deploy decision (2026-06-29): single-origin
Per [`hosting.md`](hosting.md): **one Go container serves both the static
dashboard (`web/dist`) and the API/WS**, fronted by Cloudflare. Chosen because the
frontend is hard-coded **same-origin** (WS `wss://<page-host>/stream`, relative
`fetch("/state")`); a two-subdomain split would silently drop the live demo to
offline demo mode and would need CORS the API doesn't have. Single-origin removes
CORS, removes the Cloudflare-Pages target, and matches the code unchanged.

### Landed (2026-06-29): Westbank → Westside display rename
Sector/clinic/road **display names** renamed `Westbank` → `Westside` across `web/`,
`cmd/eoc/scenario.json`, `internal/llm` (mock strings), and `internal/scenariogen`.
**IDs intentionally unchanged** (`S-WESTBANK`, `H-WESTBANK`, `R-WEST-1`, lowercase
`westbank` key) — renaming identifiers buys nothing and risks breaking refs.

### Suggested sequence (parcels are lane-isolated → run independently)
1. **P1** (contracts) — unblocks everything; lands as the single coordinated commit.
2. **P2 / P3 / P4 / P5** in parallel (distinct lanes, all depend only on P1).
3. **P6** — start (a)+(b) (static serving + `$PORT`) immediately; finish (c)+(d) once P2+P5 land.
4. **P7** once P1 shapes exist + `api` is running; **P8** once P6's serving behavior + a `web` build exist.
5. **P9** (llm OpenRouter support) + **P10** (api switch) + **P11** (cmd wiring) can run in parallel (backend lanes).
6. **P12** (UI dropdown) after backend switch surface.
7. **P13–P14** (map sizing + scrolling histories) — **independent of P9–P12**;
   scoped in [`TASK-ui-scrollback.md`](TASK-ui-scrollback.md), can start now. **P15**
   (further polish) overlaps with the provider dropdown (P12).
8. **P16** (docs/deploy) last.

**Independence guarantee:** each parcel owns a disjoint set of files —
P1=`contracts/`, P2=`internal/llm`, P3=`internal/agents`, P4=`internal/orchestrator`,
P5=`internal/api`, P6=`cmd/eoc/main.go`, P7=`web/`, P8=`Dockerfile`+`Taskfile.yml`+`.env.example`,
P9=`internal/llm`, P10=`internal/api`, P11=`cmd/eoc`, P12–P15=`web/`, P16=deploy/docs.
The only shared seam is `contracts/` (P1), so land P1 first; after that the rest
never touch the same file.

### Priority for demo impact
1. **Telemetry** (P1 + P3 + P4 + HUD half of P7) — turns the HUD's fake
   `1500 tok/s` into real wafer-scale numbers. Highest value-per-effort, fully
   verifiable in mock mode.
2. **Perception** (P2 + P5 + P6 + upload half of P7) — the live "drop a disaster
   image → instant fan-out" wow moment.
3. **Critique** (P3) — the "multi-turn still sub-second on Cerebras" beat;
   cheapest to add, mind RPM.
4. **P9–P11** enable provider comparison (global switch to OpenRouter for same model).
5. **P13–P15** address current UI problems (map too big, data areas too small, logs refresh instead of hold+scroll) + general polish.
